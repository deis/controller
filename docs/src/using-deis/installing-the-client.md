# Install the Client

The Deis command-line interface (CLI), or client, allows you to interact
with a Deis [Controller][]. You must install the client to use Deis.


## Install the Deis Client

Install the latest `deis` client for Linux or Mac OS X with:

    $ curl -sSL http://deis.io/deis-cli/install.sh | sh

The installer puts `deis` in your current directory, but you should move it
somewhere in your $PATH:

    $ ln -fs $PWD/deis /usr/local/bin/deis


## Proxy Support

If your workstation uses a proxy to reach the network where the cluster lies,
set the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` environment variable to enable proxy support:

    $ export http_proxy="http://proxyip:port"
    $ export https_proxy="http://proxyip:port"

!!! note
    Configuring a proxy is generally not necessary for local Vagrant clusters.


## Integrated Help

The Deis client comes with comprehensive documentation for every command.
Use `deis help` to explore the commands available to you:

    $ deis help
    The Deis command-line client issues API calls to a Deis controller.

    Usage: deis <command> [<args>...]

    Auth commands::

      register      register a new user with a controller
      login         login to a controller
      logout        logout from the current controller

    Subcommands, use `deis help [subcommand]` to learn more::
    ...

To get help on subcommands, use `deis help [subcommand]`:

    $ deis help apps
    Valid commands for apps:

    apps:create        create a new application
    apps:list          list accessible applications
    apps:info          view info about an application
    apps:open          open the application in a browser
    apps:logs          view aggregated application logs
    apps:run           run a command in an ephemeral app container
    apps:destroy       destroy an application

    Use `deis help [command]` to learn more


## Multiple Profile Support


The Deis client supports running commands against multiple installations
and/or accounts by setting the `$DEIS_PROFILE` environment variable
before logging in and running any subsequent commands. If not set, all
commands will default to the `client` profile which maps to
a configuration file at `$HOME/.deis/client.json`. Here's an example
of running the ps command against an app with the same name from two profiles:

    $ DEIS_PROFILE=production deis ps -a helloworld
    $ DEIS_PROFILE=staging deis ps -a helloworld
