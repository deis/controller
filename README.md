# Deis Workflow v2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deis/workflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deis/workflow) [![Go Report Card](http://goreportcard.com/badge/deis/workflow)](http://goreportcard.com/report/deis/workflow)

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to provide a lightweight, [Heroku-inspired](http://heroku.com) workflow.

## Work in Progress

Deis Workflow v2 is changing quickly. Your feedback and participation are more than welcome, but be aware that this project is considered a work in progress.

## Hacking Workflow

First, install [deis/etcd](https://github.com/deis/etcd) as described in its documentation. Ensure that the deis-etcd-service is running and healthy by accessing its port 4001 and seeing that the environment variable `DEIS_ETCD_1_SERVICE_HOST` is set.

One way to test this by running commands from another pod in the same namespace:

```console
$ kubectl exec alpine -- env | grep DEIS_ETCD_1_SERVICE | sort
DEIS_ETCD_1_SERVICE_HOST=10.247.187.217
DEIS_ETCD_1_SERVICE_PORT=2380
DEIS_ETCD_1_SERVICE_PORT_CLIENT=4100
DEIS_ETCD_1_SERVICE_PORT_PEER=2380
$ kubectl exec alpine -- curl -sS 10.247.187.217:4100/version
{"etcdserver":"2.2.1","etcdcluster":"2.2.0"}
```

Next build the deis/workflow image and push it to a Docker registry. The `$DEIS_REGISTRY` environment variable must point to a registry accessible to your Kubernetes cluster. You may need to configure the Docker engines on your Kubernetes nodes to allow `--insecure-registry 192.168.0.0/16` (or the appropriate address range).

```console
$ make docker-build docker-push
```

Finally create a PostgreSQL database and the Deis workflow service:
```console
$ make kube-create-all
kubectl create -f manifests/deis-database-rc.yml
replicationcontrollers/deis-database
kubectl create -f manifests/deis-database-service.yml
services/deis-database
kubectl create -f manifests/deis-workflow-rc.yml.tmp
replicationcontrollers/deis-workflow
kubectl create -f manifests/deis-workflow-service.yml
services/deis-workflow
$ kubectl get pod

$ kubectl logs deis-workflow-e8qks
+ export ETCD_PORT=4100
+ ETCD_PORT=4100
+ export ETCD_HOST=10.247.187.217
+ ETCD_HOST=10.247.187.217
...
```
