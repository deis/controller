# Deis Workflow v2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deis/workflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deis/workflow) [![Go Report Card](http://goreportcard.com/badge/deis/workflow)](http://goreportcard.com/report/deis/workflow)

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage
applications on your own servers. Deis builds on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to provide
a lightweight, [Heroku-inspired](http://heroku.com) workflow.

## Work in Progress

Deis Workflow v2 is changing quickly. Your feedback and participation are more than welcome, but be
aware that this project is considered a work in progress.

## Hacking Workflow

First, install [helm](http://helm.sh) and [boot up a kubernetes cluster][install-k8s]. Next, add the
deis repository to your chart list:

```console
$ helm repo add deis https://github.com/deis/charts
```

Then, install Deis!

```console
$ helm install deis/deis
```

You can then monitor their status by running

```console
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=deis
```

Once this is done, you can SSH into the minion running the controller and run the following:

```
$ curl -sSL http://deis.io/deis-cli/install.sh | sh
$ sudo mv deis /bin
$ kubectl get service --namespace=deis deis-workflow
$ deis register 10.247.59.157 # or the appropriate CLUSTER_IP
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
$ eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ deis keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
$ deis create --no-remote
Creating Application... done, created madras-radiator
$ deis pull deis/example-go -a madras-radiator
Creating build... ..o
```

If you want to hack on a new feature, build the deis/workflow image and push it to a Docker
registry. The `$DEIS_REGISTRY` environment variable must point to a registry accessible to your
Kubernetes cluster. You may need to configure the Docker engines on your Kubernetes nodes to allow
`--insecure-registry 192.168.0.0/16` (or the appropriate address range).

```console
$ make docker-build docker-push
```

You'll want to modify the deis chart to use your custom image, then run `helm install` on the
chart.
