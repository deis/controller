Running Deis without Ceph
=========================

.. include:: ../_includes/_ceph-dependency-description.rst

This guide is intended to assist users who are interested in removing the Ceph
dependency of the Deis control plane.

.. note::

  This guide was adapted from content graciously provided by Deis community member
  `Arne-Christian Blystad`_.

Requirements
------------

External services are required to replace the internal store components:

* S3-compatible blob store (like `Amazon S3`_)
* PostgreSQL database (like `Amazon RDS`_)
* Log drain service with syslog log format compatibility (like `Papertrail`_)

Understanding component changes
-------------------------------

Either directly or indirectly, all components in the :ref:`control-plane`
require Ceph (:ref:`store`). Some components require changes to accommodate
the removal of Ceph. The necessary changes are described below.

Logger
^^^^^^

The :ref:`logspout` component attaches to Docker containers on each host and
listens for log events from platform components and running applications.  It
ships these to the :ref:`logger` component.  By default, the logger writes the
logs to a distributed Ceph filesystem. These logs can then be fetched by the
:ref:`controller` component via HTTP.

In a Ceph-less clutser, the Logger component should be configured, instead, to
use in-memory log storage.  Optionally, a drain may also be configured to forward
logs to an external log service (such as Papertrail) for longer-term archival.

Database
^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`database` runs PostgreSQL and uses the Ceph S3 API (provided by
``deis-store-gateway``) to store PostgreSQL backups and WAL logs.
Should the host running database fail, the database component will fail over to
a new host, start up, and replay backups and WAL logs to recover to its
previous state.

We will not be using the database component in the Ceph-less cluster, and will
instead rely on an external database.

Registry
^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`registry` component is an instance of the offical Docker registry, and
is used to store application releases. The registry supports any S3 store, so
a Ceph-less cluster will simply reconfigure registry to use another store (typically
Amazon S3 itself).

Builder
^^^^^^^

The :ref:`builder` component is responsible for building applications deployed
to Deis via the ``git push`` workflow. It pushes to registry to store releases,
so it will require no changes.

Store
^^^^^

The :ref:`store` components implement Ceph itself. In a Ceph-less cluster, we
will skip the installation and starting of these components.

Deploying the cluster
---------------------

This guide assumes a typical deployment on AWS by following the :ref:`deis_on_aws`
guide.

Deploy an AWS cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the :ref:`deis_on_aws` installation documentation through the "Configure
DNS" portion.

Configure logger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`logger` component should be configured to use in-memory storage. Optionally
it may also be configured to drain logs to an external service for longer-term
archival.

.. code-block:: console

    $ STORAGE_ADAPTER=memory
    $ DRAIN=udp://logs.somewhere.com:12345 # Supported protocols are udp and tcp; for backwards compatibility, "syslog" is an alias for udp
    $ deisctl config logs set storageAdapterType=${STORAGE_ADAPTER} drain=${DRAIN}

Configure registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`registry` component won't start until it's configured with a store.

S3 store configuration sample:

.. code-block:: console

    $ BUCKET=MYS3BUCKET
    $ AWS_S3_REGION=some-aws-region #(e.g., us-west-1)
    $ deisctl config registry set s3bucket=${BUCKET} \
                                  s3region=${AWS_S3_REGION} \
                                  s3path=/ \
                                  s3encrypt=false \
                                  s3secure=false

By default, the registry will try to authenticate to S3 using the instance role.
If your cluster is not running on EC2, you can supply hard coded API access and
secret key:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config registry set s3accessKey=your-access-key \
                                  s3secretKey=your-secret-key

For reference, here's example of a policy you could attach to the role/user used by
the registry:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::MYBUCKET"
          ],
          "Action": [
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:GetBucketLocation"
          ],
          "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::MYBUCKET/*"
          ],
          "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:DeleteObject"
          ],
          "Effect": "Allow"
        }
      ],
      "Version": "2012-10-17"
    }

Openstack-swift support requires `Swift3`_ middleware to be installed. Here is a sample configuration:

.. code-block:: console

    $ SWIFT_CONTAINER=mycontainer
    $ SWIFT_USER=system:root
    $ SWIFT_SECRET_KEY=testpass
    $ deisctl config registry set bucketName=${SWIFT_CONTAINER}
    $ deisctl config store set gateway/accessKey=${SWIFT_USER} \
                               gateway/secretKey=${SWIFT_SECRET_KEY} \
                               gateway/host=10.1.50.1 \
                               gateway/port=8080

Configure database settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since we won't be running the :ref:`database`, we need to configure these settings
so the controller knows where to connect.

.. code-block:: console

    $ HOST=something.rds.amazonaws.com
    $ DB_USER=deis
    $ DB_PASS=somethingsomething
    $ DATABASE=deis
    $ deisctl config database set engine=postgresql_psycopg2 \
                                  host=${HOST} \
                                  port=5432 \
                                  name=${DATABASE} \
                                  user=${DB_USER} \
                                  password=${DB_PASS}

Deploy the platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The typical :ref:`install_deis_platform` documentation can be followed, with
one caveat: since we won't be deploying many of the typical Deis components, we cannot
use ``deisctl install platform`` or ``deisctl start platform`` -- instead, we
use ``deisctl install stateless-platform`` and ``deisctl start stateless-platform``.

These commands tell ``deisctl`` to skip the components that we don't need to use.

Confirm installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That's it! Deis is now running without Ceph. Issue a ``deisctl list`` to confirm
that the services are started, and see :ref:`using_deis` to start using the cluster.

Upgrading Deis
--------------

When following the :ref:`upgrading-deis` documentation, be sure to use
``stateless-platform`` instead of ``platform``.
